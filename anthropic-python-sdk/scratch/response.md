That's one of humanity's biggest and oldest philosophical questions! While I aim to be direct and honest in my responses, I can't give you a definitive answer since it's something humans have debated throughout history. I think the meaning of life is something each person needs to discover for themselves. I aim to help people explore different perspectives while acknowledging the complex and personal nature of this question.
